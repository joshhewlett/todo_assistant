# Todo Assistant
Simple CLI todo app built with Rust

## Why?
I've had an interest in learning Rust for a while now. As I was learning the basics following simple tutorials, I determined
working on a project of my own would be beneficial. Building a CLI Todo app seemed like a good entry-level project. It would
teach me project organization, accepting user input, processing data, control flow, cargo tools, basic persistence, error-
handling and more. All in a project of less than 10 files!

## How to run
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (if required)
2. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/joshhewlett/todo_assistant.git
```
3. Navigate to the project root directory
4. Execute program
```
cargo run
```
